xmonad-ubuntu by @CestDiego
==================

Still has only been tested in Ubuntu 14.04 and also install variety

# Installation

git clone git@github.com/CestDiego/xmonad-ubuntu ~/.xmonad

## Then you can run the installation script by just doing

sudo chmod +x ~/.xmonad/install-xmonad
~/.xmonad/install-xmonad

By default the Block Mayus key is Set to be an extra Control Keyh (no more Emacs Pinky)

Also xbacklight (monitor brightness) is set to be 20% of brightness by default you can change this in the ~/.xmonad/startup-hook

If you have Emacs installed it opens by default on the first workspace
